## Overview

This repository contains my "ultimate" AutoHotkey scripts for City-17 Roblox HL2RP groups.

I’ve been developing AHK tools for the Roblox HL2RP genre since 2021, and this project represents the most complete, refined, and game-tested version of those scripts. It's designed to make it easier to speak phrases or words that players say often.

## Features

### Smart Text Replacement

Automatically expands short or common phrases into full HL2RP-appropriate lines.

Examples:
- wall → Face the wall, now.
- mi → Move it.
- holdit → Hold it right there.

All replacements are editable and can be customized per server or division. It's designed to be for everyone, no matter the division. 
Text replacement responds to uppercase letters, so SPEAR or OTA members can utilize "WALL" → "FACE THE WALL, NOW" for their communications.

### Spelling Corrections

- Fixes common spelling mistakes

This helps keep your dignity when trying to act professional. I hate it when I mispell words ingame. 

---

### Rank and Title Expansion

Converts shorthand or abbreviations into proper rank titles.

Examples:
- SqL → Squadron Leader
- OfC → Officer
- Dvl → Division Leader
